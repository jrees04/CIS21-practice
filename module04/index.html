<dt>Atypical</dt>
<dd>Atypical is a show about a high functioning kid with Autism named Sam trying to live a normal life. It's a really cute show, one that gets me thinking about life. As a neurotypical, I can't imagine how difficult it is to navigate through life with Autism. By season 3, Sam gets into college and even moves out of his home into an apartment with his best friend Zahid. As I'm watching the show, I can't help but to think that each person in Sam's life plays a huge part in getting him where he is. His younger sister Casey can be described as none other thana a badass: punching bullies and wathcing out for her older brother. Elsa, the mom, immersed herself in the kids with Autism community and played a huge role in just getting him started in life. His best friend, Zahid, gives him wacky, yet helpful advice and handles Sam really well when he gets stressed out. This makes me think about how the people in our lives play a huge role in where we end up. It also makes me sad to think of all the people out there that don't have a strong support system</dd>
<dt>Falcor</dt>
<dd>Of course I have to talk about my cat, Falcor, when I have the freedom to put what I want in my webpage. I'll tell the story of how he came into my life. One day, as with many other days in our high school days, my friend and I were walking back from the convenience store to her house. There just so happened to be a lady standing outside of her house holding a kitten. As you can imagine, our teenage girl hearts absolutely MELTED at the site. So, of course, we go up to this stranger, learned her name was Julia, and asked to hold the kitten. Julia allowed, even invited us into her house to see more kittens. I know it's bad judgement to enter a total stranger's house, but the promise of seeing and holding kittens was well worth the risk. Luckily enough, we were safe. She told us how the kittens were unexpected, and she was giving them away for free with the assurance that they were going to a loving home. My friend, who already had a zoo of animals in her house, could not take one. I, however, had the room for a kitten. So, of course, I go home and ask my mom if we can get a kitten. She agreed! I didn't even need to beg! A few weeks later, my mom and I drove down the street to Julia's to pick up my baby boy. When we first get there, my mom and Julia look at each other for a second and, get this, they were friends in high school! Crazy how things work like that right? So yeah, I've managed to keep him alive for about 9 years now and counting. He's a needy mf, but the love of my life. He just, like, gets it, ya know? OKok enough about my cat. BTW his fur is very soft.</dd>
<dt>Banana</dt>
<dd>Ok now that I've talked about one of my babies, I've gotta give some attention to my other. She's a ball python and her name is Banana, and I love her. I've always known I wanted a snake, but she was definitely an impulse buy. I was walking with that very same friend, said I wanted a snake, and she encouraged. Even helped me research what kind of snake I wanted and the closest shop I could get one from. I ended up buying her that same day. When I asked the shop dude her gender, he said, "probably a girl," and thus her name became banana. I'm still pretty sure she's a girl. It can be a little complicated to sex snakes, and I've really only had the opportunity to sex this one so I'm not exactly sure what the difference is in real life. She does eat live rats; I feed her once every two weeks.</dd>
<dt>Muay Thai</dt>
<dd>Muay Thai, if you've never heard of it, is Thai kickboxing. While Muay Thai and Kickboxing have a lot of things in common, Muay Thai is a little more flexible with its rules. For example, in a Muay Thai fight, fighters are allowed to use their elbows and knees. I started Muay Thai classes back in April 2021 and my goodness was it one of the better decisions I've made with my life. I love it. I'd go every day if I could. But, of course, I can't. Because I work full time, and I'm pursuing a degree in the IT field so that takes up a lot of time. I'll definitely never be a pro fighter, but at least I can pretend when I'm in classes. One thing that I struggle with is getting myself into actual sparring because I have lots of piercings. I've made it a habit to take out all the piercings I can before class, but I have 4 piercings that are just too fresh to take out yet. It would not be a pleasant experience to have new piercings punched. I really want to get more, too, but I think I can wait a bit so I can get good at sparring</dd>
<dt>Tattoos</dt>
<dd>My god do I LOVE tattoos. Ever since I was an itty bitty child, I've known that I wanted lots of tattoos. I still do! As of right now, I have 10 tats. I can't wait to have so many that I can't even count them. My favorite styles are tradtional and neotraditional. Traditional tatto designs are made up of one line weight, lots of reds, blues, and heavy blacks. Allowing the skin color to show through (I think it's supposed to be 1/3 of the color of the tattoo) is also a big part of the style. Some commmon tattoos done in this style are the tiger, anchor, galleon, roses, and swallows. Back in the day, much of the population that had tattoos were sailors, which is why a lot of the traditional tattoos are related to sailors. I also really love neotraditional tattoos. In this style, all kinds of line weights are used to make up the image. Bright colors are also important. This style is definitely the more realistic of the two. There are other sytles, too, such as water color, geometric, and realism, all of which are pretty great, too.</dd>
